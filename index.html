    <p>So the final thing we needed before travelling to the dungeon was more arrows, so me dingle and ilex then travelled down to the villager windmill where i found our slimeballs earlier

        And traded with a fletcher to get arrows for our team. 
        
        i also enchanted everyone’s armour and we also realised we could use my bow to harvest infinite cobwebs which would definitely be helpful for holding back enemies
        
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The one problem was that all our bows had been caught while fishing and none of us had unlocked smithing 10 to use an anvil, so our bow shots would be limited inside of the dungeon.

            But with my thundering sword and a good amount of healing we were confident we could defeat the boss
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Quals decided he wanted to keep ser gregor safe and built a fake speech stand to keep him hidden

                (yeye keep him asleep so wings dont go out and they cant see him)
                
                But unlike quals, dingle decided that bingle was coming with us to the dungeon for some reason. And we all set out towards the entrance.
                
                But as we set finally out towards the dungeon, dingle decided he was going to bring his cat bingle with him for some reason
                
                </p>
                <P>We then continued across the meadow, getting closer to the dungeon

                    And eventually i spotted another horse so i could finally replace my extremely slow mount  
                    </P>
                    <p>We then spotted players in the distance but luckily their gear meant they weren’t much of a threat
                    </p>
                    <P>Scorch may have then refused to give his armor back, but ilex dropped him another set of armor to make amends and we continued forward

                        (why is my horse this slow, 1:45:35 if you left click and shift does something crazy, clips tricking scorch and dingle, finding base, take blocks. scorch raze fields)
                        
                        And after some more riding, we finally arrived at the coordinates 
                        
                        However there was nothing there
                        
                        But we then noticed that there were some placed blocks at the opening of a tunnel and decided to investigate
                        
                        </P>
                        <p>And after digging down we uncovered a colossal ancient city

                            This contained a crazy amount of chests, and had a portal to the flower dungeon at the center
                            
                            However another high level team were already exploring the city and we had absolutely no idea they were lurking nearby
                            
                            And we then decided to split up to explore two different sides of the city, putting us in danger</p>
                            <p>This void flower legendary weapon is extremely powerful, and summons giant poson spikes from the ground dealing a huge amount of damage to enemies

                                But it required the soul of the deadly void blossom boss inside the first dungeon as well as some other very rare items
                                
                                However as we were possibly the first team to discover this pedestal, I knew we had a good chance of unlocking it. so i then took a screenshot of its requirements, and we continued exploring
                                
                                (that must be an insane weapon then, gold ore, so many chests if unlooted op, spotting opressors team but desync ilex audio to fix, deciding to loot and reacting to one chest)
                                
                                Cautiously we started looting the nearby chests, but we realised that robbys team had already looted all of the good items and that’s how they were already in diamond armor
                                
                                But we then climbed up to a different floor that the other team had completely missed
                                
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>But while we were looting, robbys team had been slowly making their way towards us knowing they could easily take us down with their op gear

                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>We then realised it was too risky to stay here any longer, and decided to make a break for the dungeon portal</p>
